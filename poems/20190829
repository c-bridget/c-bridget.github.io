title:  A Letter to My Heart
---
tell me, what are you thinking of today? <br>
What memory has sprung fresh to mind <br>
flooding your senses so fully that I can feel the weight of another here some past self, far from this one <br>
warrior-princess, perhaps <br>
besieged city <br>
In our previous life we were at war, weren’t we? <br>
firestorm and sharpened sword hanging by the front door <br>
too busy watching our back to see what could have been ahead <br>
maybe we were right to do it <br>
even now the past echoes louder than the future can beckon <br>
surrounds you in an amniotic nostalgia <br>
some blurred line between floating and sinking in this slurry of former being <br>
 <br>
heart of heavy lifting: <br>
today this ribcage is unfamiliar forest <br>
not the curving canopy you know, but rafters we swung from <br>
once <br>
aortic moonlit roads we raced down <br>
scabbed knees, gripped scabbard, scraped breaths <br>
scrambling with a momentum so strong it carried us into our next life <br>
remember – what saved us then was the sense that there is always something to flee from  <br>
a village to mourn and a burden so heavy it almost feels like an embrace <br>
something ancient and thickly woven wrapping us tight with familiar warning and relief:  <br>
you have come from this <br>
you will come from this <br>
you have come from this <br>
you will come from this <br>
