Lately I've been thinking about how sound moves -- moves me
That is, sound as subject
Me, weary foot on the gas pedal, always an object
Untouched and hurtling through space -- time
Projectile of a whisper
Unwilling disciple of your voice 

on Sundays voices bounce off the chapel rafters
warmed by the gaze of these stained glass saints
return to your lips a different frequency
like the past is still praying for you
through you
the old man's car keys hit the pews
dull metal to wood just like the old inadequate idols
this church would go up in unholy flames too 
he fumbles for change and his pennies hit the bottom of the velvet bag
like a shallow exhalation of God's name

the way that shallots sizzle on the stove
and turn translucent
makes me wonder -
if I walked through fire 
would you be able to see through me?
bathe me in oil
for the days I don't feel myself
when I am marinated in too much noise

I crack open the car window and the still morning becomes turbulent
thin window
