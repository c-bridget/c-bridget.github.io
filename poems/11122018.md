Lately I've been thinking about how sound moves -- moves me <br>
That is, sound as subject <br>
Me, weary foot on the gas pedal, always an object <br>
Untouched and hurtling through space -- time <br>
Projectile of a whisper <br>
Unwilling disciple of your voice <br> 
 <br>
on Sundays voices bounce off the chapel rafters <br>
warmed by the gaze of these stained glass saints <br>
return to your lips a different frequency <br>
like the past is still praying for you <br>
through you <br>
 <br>
the old man's car keys hit the pews <br>
dull metal to wood just like the old inadequate idols <br>
this church would go up in unholy flames too <br> 
he fumbles for change and his pennies hit the bottom of the velvet bag <br>
like a shallow exhalation of God's name <br>
 <br>
the way that shallots sizzle on the stove <br>
and turn translucent <br>
makes me wonder - <br>
if I walked through fire <br> 
would you be able to see through me? <br>
bathe me in oil <br>
sprinkle salt on me in my sleep <br>
for the days I don't feel myself <br>
when I've marinated in too much noise <br>
<br>
As I accelerate the still air starts to roar
throb against the driver's side window cracked open
