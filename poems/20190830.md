title:  A Relative Humidity
---

mornings after a big thunderstorm when everyone still has their highbeams on <br>
two more bright moons dotting through air already clean and perforated <br>
punctuating as the sun steams away the wrinkles in the asphalt <br>
and daylight moves us into run-on sentences <br>
 <br>
I too am eager to meet tomorrow <br>
even scraping evening from beneath my fingernails <br>
side of my face still warm from each prayer shot through with halogen <br>
last night we hunted <br>
each morsel of raindrop illuminated in suspended slant <br>
licking the thunder from my fingers as I pocketed the cut off the broad back  <br>
carving the sloped shoulder into seconds I could hold in cupped hands <br>
for an instant I saw our future poured out in full <br>
 <br>
after today, the predator slinks back home for the respite <br>
prey lies serene but not unchanged <br>
dawn comes like a feast <br>
banquet of light and momentum laid out before me <br>
I scour the table for sight obscured, still <br>
too busy making something out of nothing to eat
