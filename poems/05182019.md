today is our first Friday dictation
the teacher has her hair in a light brown bun
severe
turning the piano away from us so we cannot see the keys
I am not used to this side of the lacquered wood, gleaming a black mirrored mystery
I look down at the blank staff paper before me
rows of white and black but not quite right
a bright yellow pencil with a worn-out eraser wobbles as I kick the rungs of the desk

the teacher says to write as she plays
I draw the high C
full moon note with a line through the middle
I hurry to the G but she is already gone
slur to link the quarter notes together
the way they melted into each other
sliding down the curving chasm of my outer ear, dripping into my brain
a mess
the boy next to me has been taking private lessons for a long time
his brown hair is messy from playing capture the flag during the lunch
I played too, but I was always too scared to run over into the enemy's territory
plus I wasn't very fast
my breakaway sprints always ending in roundabout loops
left-leaning counterclockwise spiral of safe
me curving back in on myself towards home
he's scribbling so quickly each note is just a dash with a soft, quick stem
a match being struck
above the A, the stems point down
demurring on behalf of balance even as their bodies climb towards heaven 

I have three measures down
I think about the rosebush we use as jail out in the field
and my legs, churning up the hill after someone finally frees me
with a palm slapped across my palm like a gasp for air
an eighth note laugh caught on the top of my throat
