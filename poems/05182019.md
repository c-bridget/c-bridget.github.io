today is our first Friday dictation <br>
the teacher has her hair in a light brown bun <br>
severe <br>
turning the piano away from us so we cannot see the keys <br>
I am not used to this side of the lacquered wood, gleaming a black mirrored mystery <br>
I look down at the blank staff paper before me <br>
rows of white and black but not quite right <br>
a bright yellow pencil with a worn-out eraser wobbles as I kick the rungs of the desk <br>
 <br>
the teacher says to write as she plays <br>
I draw the high C <br>
full moon note with a line through the middle <br>
I hurry to the G but she is already gone <br>
slur to link the quarter notes together <br>
the way they melted into each other <br>
sliding down the curving chasm of my outer ear, dripping into my brain <br>
a mess <br>
the boy next to me has been taking private lessons for a long time <br>
his brown hair is messy from playing capture the flag during the lunch <br>
I played too, but I was always too scared to run over into the enemy's territory <br>
plus I wasn't very fast <br>
my breakaway sprints always ending in roundabout loops <br>
left-leaning counterclockwise spiral of safe <br>
me curving back in on myself towards home <br>
he's scribbling so quickly each note is just a dash with a soft, quick stem <br>
a match being struck <br>
above the A, the stems point down <br>
demurring on behalf of balance even as their bodies climb towards heaven  <br>
 <br>
I have three measures down <br>
I think about the rosebush we use as jail out in the field <br>
and my legs, churning up the hill after someone finally frees me <br>
with a palm slapped across my palm like a gasp for air <br>
an eighth note laugh caught on the top of my throat <br>
