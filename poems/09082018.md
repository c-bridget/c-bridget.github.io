you asked, _do you love him?_ <br>
and I said, _he makes me happy_ <br>
which didn't answer the question <br>
but I think I only know love as something fighting through the pain <br>
as someone bending your heart to fit -- <br>
as weight <br>
<br>
didn't they teach us to pray these words <br>
-- may my hands and feet be used -- <br>
didn't they call that worship? <br>
I guess I thought a temple is just something you enter into <br>
would you turn your face away <br>
to tear me in two? <br>
