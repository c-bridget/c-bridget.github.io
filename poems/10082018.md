<<<<<<< HEAD
And I always thought words were weight <br>
Wait <br>
until they are something you can longer carry around your neck <br>
breaking the seams of your hidden pockets <br>
only then are they truly gems <br>

this world wasn't made for me to tread lightly in <br>
cradled me only in its trenches <br>
baptism mouth open in these muddied waters swallowing my sin and coloring my whole body with it <br>
what's face value worth if you couldn't tell me apart from a stranger? <br>
 <br>
Now I demand opacity <br> 
I still deserve solid ground <br> 
I want to look the moon in its waning face <br>
and not squint for the shadow of fullness in hiding <br>
for just this night I find the dying light enough <br>
I sing the songs I want and they are not the ones my mother taught me <br>
I speak a dream and it is full, full color <br>
for just this night - it is enough <br>
 <br>
The ocean stretches to hold me and all my invisible <br>
I find strangers floating in its crests and see myself in them <br>
even if they hate me <br>
even if they had wanted me to drown <br>
I laugh at my own absence now <br>
