And I always thought words were weight
Wait
until they are something you can longer carry around your neck
breaking the seams of your hidden pockets
only then are they truly gems

this world wasn't made for me to tread lightly in
cradled me only in its trenches
baptism mouth open in these muddied waters swallowing my sin and coloring my whole body with it
what's face value worth if you couldn't tell me apart from a stranger?

Now I demand opacity 
I still deserve solid ground 
I want to look the moon in its waning face
and not squint for the shadow of fullness in hiding
for just this night I find the dying light enough
I sing the songs I want and they are not the ones my mother taught me
I speak a dream and it is full, full color
for just this night - it is enough

The ocean stretches to hold me and all my invisible
I find strangers floating in its crests and see myself in them
even if they hate me
even if they had wanted me to drown
I laugh at my own absence
