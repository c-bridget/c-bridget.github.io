And I always thought words were weight <br>
Wait <br>
until this string of pearls around your neck threatens to drag you into the river <br>
this world wasn't made for me to tread lightly in <br>
cradled me only in its trenches <br>
baptism mouth open in these muddied waters swallowing my sin and coloring my whole body with it <br>
what's face value worth if you couldn't tell me apart from a stranger? <br>
 <br>
Now I demand opacity <br> 
I want to look the moon in its waning face <br>
and not squint for the shadow of fullness in hiding <br>
for just this night I find the dying light enough <br>
I speak a dream I cannot see and it is full, full color <br>
for just this night - it is enough <br>
 <br>
The ocean stretches to hold me and all my invisible <br>
I find strangers in its crests and see myself in them <br>
I laugh at my own absence <br> 
island-borne but still deserving of solid ground <br> 
fill my words with helium <br>
buoyant on generations of hope deferred <br>
from now on I am heavy for no one <br>
<br>
I claim every budding life in reach <br>
sprouting from my very breath <br>
a garden of dimensions <br>
for once I feel no guilt <br>
at the breaking of a stem between my fingers
