And I always thought words were weight
Wait
until they are something you can longer hang around your neck
only then are they truly gems

this world wasn't made for me to tread lightly in
cradled me only in its trenches
baptism mouth open in these muddied waters swallowing my sin
and now I demand opacity 
what's face value worth if you couldn't tell me apart from a stranger?

I still deserve solid ground
