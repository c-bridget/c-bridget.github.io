Today I woke up heavy. <br>
Maybe it's the raindrops hanging in the air <br>
Threatening each other to let go <br>
we say leap of faith <br>
As if what goes up doesn't have to come down if you just believe hard enough <br>
As if I didn't jump praying to God that I would fall <br>
hard enough <br>
 <br>
on the worst days the morning sun is an altar I would gladly throw myself upon <br>
hoping for some divine intervention of incineration <br>
sand-flash  into  glass <br>
into  prism <br>
I'm already an expert at refracting <br>
 <br>
I am under the weather. <br>
As in there are clouds overhead <br>
or in my head, hovering around my brain <br>
grey matter meets grey matter <br>
I'm communing with the cumulus and I see stormfronts coming <br>
 <br>
I want to believe that God is a poet, <br>
too <br>
that there will come a pillar of fire to lead me through the night instead of extinguishing me into it <br>
that there is a triumph to being paper thin and then torn in two <br>
that it only feels like this because, like the pastor said, <br>
the earliest hours of Easter Sunday still looked a lot like Good Friday night <br>
remember that God has made holy by making empty before <br>
someday the stone will roll away, and I will sit with bated breath  <br>
beneath this break of dawn <br>
waiting to see what's left <br>
