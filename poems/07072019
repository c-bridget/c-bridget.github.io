on the side of the road I saw
a flash of ribcage sunk into the dark maw of a prophecy laid bare
time staking its claim
all your colored, gleaming fur
now matted; now tufted; now anchored to nothing,
not even your own body. blown into the nearby bushes
could almost be mistaken for petals unmoored by the recent rainstorm
but all nature knows the stench of death
maybe the landscape will rot in deference
to say, we saw it happen
saw you bursting, spent
blood rushing forth to anoint the pavement
felt your final exhalation on the mulch 
watched as nature invaded your body
created footholds to be splayed open by the still summer air
organs basking in our hottest sun
burning, like this, is a semblance of life
a memory of purpose
oh blackened stomach
oh dried-out liver,
did you know it would come to this?
did you imagine yourself someday as spectacle
gristling into stone tablet 
god's finger forming your dark flesh into its final auspice
in this moment I am Moses,
bearing witness to something sacred before it shatters
nameless commandment. no genus, no species
all things succumb to the mantle of earth
