But I came from this
from blast caps and ballast and burial
born tunneling into the earth
put me up to your eye,
call me stone. gem, even -
the same patterns repeating themselves over and over until someone called me beauty 
and they all believed me. believed in me.
skeletons in the bedrock,
a life a trick of light 
cut me down for size. I'll fit around your finger
make you a promise
sing like a canary in this cave 
you'd think the sun shone here too
think I never ran out of air to breathe
