But I came from this <br>
from blast caps and ballast and burial <br>
born tunneling into the earth <br>
put me up to your eye, <br>
call me stone. gem, even - <br>
the same patterns repeating themselves over and over until someone called me beauty <br> 
and they all believed me -- believed in me. <br>
skeletons in the bedrock, <br>
a life a trick of light <br>
you'd think the sun shone here too <br>
think I never ran out of air to breathe <br> 
or carbon to crush <br>
cut me down for size. I'll fit around your finger <br>
remind you of a promise <br>
a canary song <br>
as the walls came down <br>
at least you'll always remember the melody
