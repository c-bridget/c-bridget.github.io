But I came from this
from blast caps and ballast and burial
born crawling away from light
just a few more layers before I go
put me up to your eye
call me stone. gem, even -
the same patterns repeating themselves over and over until someone called me beauty 
and they all believed me. believed in me.
skeletons in the bedrock
a life a trick of light 
cut me down for size. I'll fit around your finger
make you a promise
