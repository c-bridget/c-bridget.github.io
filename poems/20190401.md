April: a suspended birdsong <br>
oh  —  four <br>
an assortment of fish bones <br>
tastes like nothing on my tongue <br>
goes down hidden in a mass of white flesh <br>
grey scales <br>
I’m playing music loud this month <br>
clearing the leftover March from my ears <br>
white stuffing like the dogwoods along the highways <br>
each blossom so sure in a haze of young green <br>
maybe someday, I will see the face of God  <br>
I’m overcaffeinating this month <br>
trying to find one needle in the haystack <br>
just one searing point <br>
to pierce from the bridge of my nose through the closest reflective surface <br>
pin me to my present self —  <br>
her eyes look scared <br>
tears stored in the back of our throat <br>
I’m keeping the windows open this month. <br>
April showers smell like saltwater <br>
maybe bring me the ocean <br>
maybe bring me a ray of light on a silver platter <br>
8 minutes and twenty seconds to get to this place <br>
to stretch yourself out upon this altar of an earth <br>
and coax it back into faith <br>
convert me to your gospel of insolation <br>
teach me how to leave home and not look back <br>
