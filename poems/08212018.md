my mother's been binge eating fortune cookies again
I know because she likes to hide the fortunes when she's done
I keep finding slips of paper tucked behind the bathroom mirror
buried in the herb garden
braided in my hair
I see lucky red numbers stuck to the kitchen sink
prospects too big to wash down the drain --

Learn Chinese.
casual echoes of my ancestors
suddenly these words become sacred on the basis of who might have once said them:
蘋果 - píngguǒ - apple
電視 - diànshì - television
女兒 - nǚ'ér - daughter
how about another fortune?
another contoured crisp to dissolve on your tongue
already numb from the heavy lifting
from the weight of worry in two languages

at 2 AM the crinkle of plastic almost sounds like the money we don't have
factory blend of flour and starch could be dad's home cooking
if dad were home
if dad could cook
after all, these hands once worked assembly lines too
once put together things just to see them broken 
in two

媽媽, how about another fortune?
how about - just one more
moment
when the future does not rest on you alone?
