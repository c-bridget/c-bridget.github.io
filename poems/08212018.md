_my mother's been binge eating fortune cookies again <br>
I know because she likes to hide the fortunes when she's done <br>
I keep finding slips of paper tucked behind the bathroom mirror <br>
buried in the herb garden <br>
braided in my hair <br>
I see lucky red numbers stuck to the kitchen sink <br>
prospects too big to wash down the drain -- <br>
 <br>
Learn Chinese. <br>
casual echoes of my ancestors <br>
suddenly these words become sacred on the basis of who might have once said them: <br>
蘋果 - píngguǒ - apple <br>
電視 - diànshì - television <br>
女兒 - nǚ'ér - daughter <br>
how about another fortune? <br>
another contoured crisp to dissolve on your tongue <br>
already numb from the heavy lifting <br>
from the weight of worry in two languages <br>

at 2 AM the crinkle of plastic almost sounds like the money we don't have <br>
factory blend of flour and starch could be dad's home cooking <br>
if dad were home <br>
if dad could cook <br>
after all, these hands once worked assembly lines too <br>
once put together things just to see them broken  <br>
in two <br>
 <br>
媽媽, how about another fortune? <br>
how about - just one more <br>
moment <br>
when the future does not rest on you alone?_
