An ode to airplane strangers <br>
specifically, the man who sat in the aisle seat next to me on our way back from Los Angeles <br>
whose face I forgot the moment I sat down <br>
I watched you type furiously on your laptop <br>
as you shifted in your seat <br>
then as we crossed the Rockies, slid your left elbow over until it met mine <br>
and didn’t move away <br>
our forearms counterbalancing on my armrest for eternity <br>
 <br>
I would have given my life for the pieces of fabric between our skin <br>
for all my fatality concentrated in that one point of contact <br>
proof that a light does dim before it finally goes out <br>
my veins the asymptote of all my half-lives sparking into oblivion with every second <br>
that we refused to acknowledge how indiscernible an infinity between us <br>
ulnas settling into each other like the intimate resignation of the dying to decay <br>
 <br>
when the plane landed <br>
you didn’t turn your face towards me <br>
and I walked away without looking back  <br>
