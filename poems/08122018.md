description:	North Carolina summers got me feeling some typa way
---

_August like expanse <br>
like peonies climbing up my legs in honey <br>
like even lightning moves in slow motion -- <br>
earth pushes upwards to sear new lifelines into its palms <br>
sky breathes a frequency of expectation <br>
and I always think I see rain coming
<br><br>
August like everything is bursting open <br>
vertebrae gears, ungreased <br>
a steady friction. furnace. <br>
heart vibrates, <br>
blood harmonics, wavelengths <br>
coming through the window screens
<br><br>
"I love you" lies heaviest on my tongue this time of year <br>
ready to crack through the eggshell <br>
I'll spill out all yolk for you <br>
-- all speckled pale <br>
-- translucence at your feet <br>
-- could have been some kind of life, some day <br>
a membrane's plea for remembrance <br>
at least at one point, I held it all together._
