August like expanse

like peonies climbing up my legs in honey

like even lightning moves in slow motion --

earth pushes upwards to sear new lifelines into its palms

sky breathes a frequency of expectation

and I always think I see rain coming


August like everything is bursting open

vertebrae gears, ungreased

a steady friction. furnace.

heart vibrates,

blood harmonics, wavelengths

coming through the window screens


"I love you" lies heaviest on my tongue this time of year

ready to crack through the eggshell

I'll spill out all yolk for you

-- all speckled pale

-- translucence at your feet

-- could have been some kind of life, some day

a membrane's plea for remembrance

at least at one point, I held it all together.
