on the side of the road I saw <br>
a flash of ribcage, sunk into the dark maw of a prophecy laid bare <br>
time staking its claim <br>
all your colored, gleaming fur <br>
now matted; now tufted; now anchored to nothing, <br>
not even your own body. blown into the nearby bushes <br>
could almost be mistaken for petals unmoored by the recent rainstorm <br>
but all nature knows the stench of death <br>
maybe the landscape will rot in deference <br>
to say, we saw it happen <br>
saw you bursting, spent <br>
blood rushing forth to anoint the pavement <br>
felt your final exhalation on the mulch <br>
watched as nature invaded your body <br>
created perforations and footholds to be splayed open by the still summer air <br>
organs basking in our hottest sun <br>
burning, like this, is a semblance of life <br>
a memory of purpose <br>
oh blackened stomach <br>
oh dried-out liver, <br>
did you know it would come to this? <br>
did you imagine yourself someday as spectacle <br>
gristling into stone tablet  <br>
hardened exodus <br>
god's finger forming your dark flesh into its final auspice <br>
in this moment I am Moses, <br>
bearing witness to something sacred before it shatters <br>
nameless commandment. no genus, no species <br>
a testament arrested in the stained shroud of pavement <br>
yes, I do believe in destiny.
