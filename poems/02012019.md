i don’t do extended metaphors anymore
right now it is an aftermath
and nothing reminds me of you
because how can it 
when you are weighing heavy between my temples
stretching to the soles of my feet 
and i think i’ve won but really what i think is 
i should leave the door unlocked tonight 

what i really wanted was to come home and find you sitting on the front steps
my god what a sight
and i would have closed the garage door with the exhaust still on 
happier
than that time the three of us walked along Lake Michigan in the dark 
and my stockings ripped like a minute passing you by
staccato seams checkerboard outer thighs
torn agape, laughing 
and i felt so full of possibility i could have swallowed the whole lakefill
then maybe we would have found your friend 
and slapped his bloated cheeks until all the limestone spilled from his blue lips
and asked him to teach us how he held his breath like that
