i don’t do extended metaphors anymore <br>
right now it is an aftermath <br>
and nothing reminds me of you <br>
because how can it  <br>
when you are weighing heavy somewhere between my temples and the soles of my feet <br>
and i think i’ve won but really what i think is  <br>
i should leave the door unlocked tonight  <br>
 <br>
what i wanted most was to come home and find you sitting on the front steps <br>
my god what a sight <br>
and i would have closed the garage door with the exhaust still on  <br>
happier <br>
than that time the three of us walked along Lake Michigan in the dark  <br>
and my stockings ripped like a minute passing you by <br>
staccato seams checkerboard outer thighs <br>
torn agape, laughing  <br>
and i felt so full of possibility i could have swallowed the whole lakefill <br>
then maybe we would have found your friend  <br>
and slapped his bloated cheeks until all the limestone spilled from his blue lips <br>
and asked him to teach us how he held his breath like that
