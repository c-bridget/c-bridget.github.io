title:  迷路
---

In Chinese, the word for “return” is 回 <br>
one open mouth (口) inside another <br>
as a young woman my mother strayed so far from home that she could not find her way back <br> 
so she birthed me out of hunger <br>
tucked a map inside my swollen cheeks before I even had a chance to cry <br>
fed me until she was full again <br>
 <br>
when I was a child I kept my mouth shut <br>
afraid to lose the grains of rice (米) on my tongue <br>
lining the lanes of that endless ridged road (路) <br>
I hoped that if I swallowed enough words they would blaze a trail to a place where I could belong  <br>
turns out streets paved with gold are silent in their gleaming and no easier to navigate <br>
 <br>
口 inside 口 — as if my ancestors knew how it feels when there are no open doors for you to enter into <br>
when you forget the word for home: <br>
run your finger along your gums <br>
dislodge the compass rose from between your molars <br>
leave syllables as breadcrumbs for those who may come after  <br>
when there is nowhere to turn back to: <br>
believe that there will be those who come after <br>
mispronounce your own name <br>
build a roof over your head <br>
learn to swallow yourself whole
