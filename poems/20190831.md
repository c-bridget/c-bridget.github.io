title:  迷路

In Chinese, the word for “return” is 回 <br>
one open mouth (口) inside another<br>
as a young woman my mother strayed so far from home that she could not find her way back<br>
so she birthed me out of hunger<br>
tucked a map inside my swollen cheeks before I even had a chance to cry<br>
fed me until she was full again<br>
<br>
when I was young I kept my mouth closed<br>
afraid to lose the grains of rice on my tongue<br>
lined lanes of an endlessly ridged road, believing<br>
if I swallowed enough words they would blaze a trail to a place where I could belong<br> 
turns out streets paved with gold are silent in their gleaming
<br>
口 inside 口 — as if I was born to know how it feels when there are no doors to enter into<br> 
when you forget the word for home:<br>
run your finger along your gums<br>
dislodge the compass rose from between your molars<br>
when you have nowhere to return to: <br>
leave syllables as breadcrumbs<br>
build a roof over your head, and <br>
learn to swallow yourself whole
