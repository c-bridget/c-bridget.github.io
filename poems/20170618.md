my father also grew up <br>
with a first language that was not his parents' <br>
coming home was just one more journey lost in translation <br>
when my grandmother stayed out late she would leave a note on the fridge <br>
misspelled nouns, no prepositions: <br>
I will be home soon <br>
or maybe, I will be home angry? <br>
I will be angry -- soon? <br>
in a house of dialects swirling into one another <br>
no one ever thinks to slip _I love you_ in between the lines <br>
<br>
my father also grew up <br>
being asked, "but where are you _really_ from?" <br>
the tongue that he did share with his parents <br>
was too much wild deer to ever be domesticated onto paper <br>
all the cities that my grandfather used to sing about <br>
couldn't be found on any maps except the one on the soles of his feet <br>
<br>
when I was five years old, my teachers tried to convince me that I was spelling my own name wrong. <br>
_Papai_, every time I tell someone, <br>
"there's no h" <br>
I think of you. <br>
whooping as you sled down the sand dunes of Fortaleza <br>
ordering my favorite _pão de queijo_ at the padaria <br>
(you always got two loaves, so that there would be more than enough for the both of us) <br>
whispering to the dog -- _cachorrinho, cãozinho_ -- when you thought we weren't listening <br>

爸爸 -- when you cross the Hudson on the way to work, do you think of the Rio or the 淡水? <br>
Dad -- do you also dream in every language you've ever used to tell someone you love them?
