I don't call home anymore these days
not with grandma sharpening her teeth 
Auntie peeling away her heart's cloves
the blood's all spoiled now
didn't know platelets could go rancid like this 
leave me wondering which vein in my arm will turn me so cruel someday

my cousins and I were all prone to tics
spent our childhoods blinking too much too fast
or widening our eyes in perpetual disbelief 
always wanting to wake up
E. categorizes rocks on floor to ceiling shelves
finds order in the shifting of the ground beneath his feet
hoping to claim prehistoric for present 
Fe asks, "are you happy now?" and each of us answers in a different language
most comfortable when we can't be understood

I remember how stunned we all were when grandpa offered to pray for the meal that one Thanksgiving
I had never seen him bow or kneel
and dad said it was because his joints had stiffened 
but it's not arthritis if your heart won't bend
