I don't call home anymore these days <br>
not with grandma sharpening her teeth <br>
Auntie peeling away her heart's cloves <br>
the blood's all spoiled now <br>
didn't know platelets could go rancid like this  <br>
leave me wondering which vein in my arm will turn me so cruel someday <br>
 <br>
my cousins and I were all prone to tics <br>
spent our childhoods blinking too much too fast <br>
or widening our eyes in perpetual disbelief  <br>
always wanting to wake up from the scenes we were living <br>
E. categorizes rocks on floor to ceiling shelves <br>
finds order in the shifting of the ground beneath his feet <br>
hoping to claim prehistoric for present  <br>
Fe asks, "are you happy now?" and each of us answers in a different language <br>
most comfortable when we can't be understood <br>
 <br>
I remember how stunned we all were when grandpa offered to pray for the meal that one Thanksgiving <br>
I had never seen him bow or kneel <br>
and dad said it was because his joints had stiffened  <br>
but it's not arthritis if your heart won't bend <br>
