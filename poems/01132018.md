_sal_ — salt, like the taste in my mouth when you leave in the mornings — _una salida_ <br>
I wish you’d stay <br>
wish I could keep swimming in these Sunday sheets with you, <br>
each wrinkle a wave <br>
sun treading through the blinds, horizontal tan lines across your right shoulder <br>
I wouldn’t mind finding handfuls of sand for days after <br>
tucked behind my ear, creased on the inside of my elbow <br>
call them grains of gold, if they could have once held your footprint
