Already this lie is heavy on my tongue 
coated in something murky and dull and bitter
I swallow and feel silence scrape the contours of my throat
smog fills my mouth
the crooked skyline of my bottom teeth
an imperfect row 
reaching towards darkness
towards light
the reflection of my smile is a reminder that the world exists in three dimensions
and then there's time itself
stretching open the back of my gums like thick cords of taffy
