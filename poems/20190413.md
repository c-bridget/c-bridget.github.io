these days I don’t really pray anymore <br>
but sometimes it’s easier to lift up a stranger’s soul than your own: <br>
I pray for paths paved smooth <br>
that you shed all your tears like an old snakeskin <br>
hold tight to the gooey putty self left in the scaled remains <br>
feel it imprint into the palm of your hand <br>
fill in the negative space of your life lines, these slow moving tributaries <br>
there is no rush to grow teeth <br>
stay shapeless as long as you wish <br>
ooze from room to room until you are ready to open up the door and venture out the front steps one drop at a time <br>
 <br>
did you hear they took a photo of a black hole? <br>
or at least: all the space gas swirling around it <br>
spiraling into visibility in three – four – five dimensions — <br>
which is to say that sometimes, even all the light in the universe gathering to surround you will only serve to remind you of the biggest hole in your life  <br>
which is to say <br>
loss is magnetic <br>
which is to say  <br>
even the heavens need a moment to collapse given the weight of all their pasts
