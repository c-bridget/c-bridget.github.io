Already this lie is heavy on my tongue <br>
coated in something murky and dull and bitter <br>
I swallow and feel silence scrape the contours of my throat <br>
smog fills my mouth <br>
the crooked skyline of my bottom teeth <br>
an imperfect row  <br>
reaching towards darkness <br>
towards light <br>
the reflection of my smile is a reminder that the world exists in three dimensions <br>
and then there's time itself <br>
stretching open the back of my gums like thick cords of taffy <br>
