today is our first Friday dictation <br>
the teacher with her hair up in a light brown bun <br>
turns the piano away from us so we cannot see the keys <br>
I am not used to this side of the lacquered wood <br>
gleaming a black mirrored mystery <br>
I look down at the blank staff paper before me <br>
I kick the legs of the desk and the pencil with its worn eraser wobbles <br>
as she plays, I draw the high C <br>
full moon note with a line through the middle <br>
I hurry to the G but it is already gone <br>
slur to link the quarter notes together as they melt into each other <br>
sliding down the curving chasm of my outer ear, dripping into my brain <br>
a mess moving in translation <br>
the boy next to me has been taking private lessons for a long time <br>
his hair is messy from playing capture the flag during lunch <br>
I played too, but I was too slow and scared to run into enemy territory <br>
my breakaway sprints becoming roundabout loops <br>
left-leaning counterclockwise spirals of safe <br>
me curving back in on myself towards home <br>
heâ€™s scribbling so quickly each note is just a dash with a soft, quick stem <br>
a match being struck <br>
a melody ignites <br>
above the A, the notes reach down <br>
demurring on behalf of balance even as their bodies climb towards heaven <br>
I have three measures down <br>
I think about the rosebush we use as jail out in the field <br>
and my legs, churning up the hill after someone finally frees me with a palm slapped across my palm like a gasp for air <br>
a beat of laughter caught at the top of my throat
