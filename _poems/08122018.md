August like expanse\
like peonies climbing up my legs in honey\
like even lightning moves in slow motion --\
earth pushes upwards to sear new lifelines into its palms\
sky breathes a frequency of expectation\
and I always think I see rain coming


August like everything is bursting open\
vertebrae gears, ungreased\
a steady friction. furnace.\
heart vibrates,\
blood harmonics, wavelengths\
coming through the window screens


"I love you" lies heaviest on my tongue this time of year\
ready to crack through the eggshell\
I'll spill out all yolk for you\
  all speckled pale\
  translucence at your feet\
  could have been some kind of life, someday\
a membrane's plea for remembrance\
at least at one point, I held it all together.
